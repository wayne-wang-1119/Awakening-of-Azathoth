# Awakening-of-Azathoth
In the game “Awakening of Azathoth”, a player has a limited number of tries to reveal a word by guessing letters, one at a time. Each time a player guesses a correct letter, all occurrences of that letter in the word are revealed. But when a player guesses an incorrect letter, they lose one of their guesses and no letters are revealed. If the player reveals the word before they run out of guesses, Azathoth continues its slumber, but if they run out of guesses, Azathoth is awakened, and the game is lost.
